# Email Classification Project
This project aims to classify emails based on their content using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains email messages along with their corresponding labels.

## Project Structure
Loading the Dataset: We load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features (subject, date, from) from the email messages.
Data Analysis: Analyzing the extracted features to understand their distribution.
Data Preparation: Preparing the data for training and testing.
Model Training: Training a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's accuracy on the test data.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
