# Some ML learning projects explanation and code

## Email Calassification
This project aims to classify emails based on their content using various machine learning techniques. 
The dataset contains email messages along with their corresponding labels.

## ML FastAPI Docker Heroku 
This project aims to detect the language of a given text using machine learning techniques. The dataset
contains text samples labeled with their respective languages

## ML_Models
This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning techniques including linear 
regression, polynomial regression, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) using 
Python and scikit-learn.

## Book Rating ML Project 
The aim of this project is to train and evaluate different models that predict a bookâ€™s rating from 
a GoodReads dataset.

## MachineLearningHousingCorp
The objective of this project is to predict house prices in California using data from 1990.

## MNIST Classification
This project explores various machine learning classification tasks applied to the MNIST dataset, 
including binary, multiclass, multilabel, and multioutput classification. We also delve into error 
analysis to identify common misclassifications and strategies to improve model performance.

## TITANIC Classification
This project tackles the classic Titanic dataset, aiming to predict whether a passenger survived 
the Titanic disaster. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze and model the data to build 
a classification system that predicts survival based on attributes such as age, sex, class, 
and embarkation location.

## SPAM Classifier
This project builds a Spam Classifier using the Apache SpamAssassin Public Corpus. The goal is 
to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content.
