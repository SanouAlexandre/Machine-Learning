# MachineLearningHousingCorp
The objective : 
To predict house prices in California using data from 1990. We'll employ an end-to-end process 
to build a robust machine learning model that can predict housing prices based on various features. 
This includes data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

# 1. Problem Understanding
Objective: Predict housing prices based on features such as location, number of rooms, and population 
in California in 1990.

Type of Problem: Regression (predicting continuous values)
Target Variable: Median house value
Features: Population, number of rooms, location (latitude, longitude), median income, etc.

# 2. Data Collection
We'll use the California Housing Dataset , containing 
data on various districts in California from the 1990 census.

Key Features in the dataset:

longitude: Longitude of the district
latitude: Latitude of the district
housing_median_age: Median age of the houses
total_rooms: Total number of rooms per district
total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms per district
population: Population per district
households: Number of households per district
median_income: Median income per household in the district
median_house_value: Median house price per district (our target variable)

# 3. Data Exploration (EDA)
Once the dataset is collected, the next step is to explore the data to understand its structure, 
distribution, and any patterns that might be useful for prediction.

Steps in EDA:

Check missing values: Use df.isnull().sum()
Descriptive statistics: Use df.describe() to get a sense of the distributions.
Histograms and distribution plots: For each feature, check the distribution using seaborn/matplotlib.
Correlations: Check for correlations using df.corr() to identify relationships between features and the target.
Visualize geographical data: Use scatterplots for latitude and longitude to visualize the districts and their house prices.

# 4. Data Preprocessing
Key Preprocessing Steps:

Handle missing values: For features like total_bedrooms, either impute missing values (with the mean/median) or drop them.
Feature scaling: Scale numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to improve model performance.
Feature Engineering: Add new features such as rooms_per_household, bedrooms_per_room, and population_per_household for better predictive power.

One-hot encoding: Encode categorical features if needed.
Steps:

Splitting the data: Split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split (typically 80-20 or 70-30 split).
Pipeline: Build a pipeline that handles all preprocessing steps (imputation, scaling, feature engineering) in a reproducible way.

# 5. Modeling
Once preprocessing is done, weâ€™ll build various machine learning models to predict the house price.

Models to Try:

Linear Regression: Baseline model for regression problems.
Decision Trees: A non-linear model that can capture complex relationships.
Random Forests: An ensemble method that generally performs better than individual decision trees.

# 6. Model Evaluation
For regression tasks, we will use the following evaluation metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences between actual and predicted values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE, giving us a sense of the error in the same unit as the target variable.

# 7. Fine-Tuning
After evaluating the models, fine-tune the best-performing model  using techniques like:

Cross-validation to ensure the model performs well on unseen data.
Grid Search or Randomized Search to find the best hyperparameters.
