# MNIST Classification

## Project Overview
This project explores various machine learning classification tasks applied to the MNIST dataset, 
including binary, multiclass, multilabel, and multioutput classification. We also delve into error
analysis to identify common misclassifications and strategies to improve model performance.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images, each of size 28x28 pixels, representing 
handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Types of Classification
1. Binary Classification
In binary classification, we simplify the problem by selecting two digits (e.g., "0" and "1")
and train a model to classify images as either one or the other. This task introduces basic
classification concepts and evaluation methods.

3. Multiclass Classification
In multiclass classification, the model is trained to recognize all ten digits (0-9) in the
MNIST dataset. Common algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, and Neural Networks are
applied and compared.

5. Multilabel Classification
In multilabel classification, each input can be assigned multiple labels. For example, we could
label each image based on whether it contains specific patterns (e.g., loops or lines) in
addition to identifying the digit itself. This task explores models capable of handling such outputs.

7. Multioutput Classification
Multioutput classification is a more complex problem where each input may have multiple outputs
that can be either binary or multiclass. For instance, we could predict both the digit and a
corresponding feature (e.g., the stroke width) for each image.

## Error Analysis
Error analysis helps identify the areas where our models perform poorly. Misclassifications are
analyzed in detail to uncover common failure modes such as confusing similar digits (e.g., "3" and "8"). 
This analysis provides insights into potential improvements, such as:

Data augmentation: Increase model robustness by simulating different writing styles.
Algorithm tuning: Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
Ensemble models: Combine multiple models to reduce individual weaknesses.
