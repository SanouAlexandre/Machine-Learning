# MNIST Classification

## Project Overview
This project explores various machine learning classification tasks applied to the MNIST dataset, 
including binary, multiclass, multilabel, and multioutput classification. We also delve into error
analysis to identify common misclassifications and strategies to improve model performance.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images, each of size 28x28 pixels, representing 
handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Types of Classification
1. Binary Classification
In binary classification, we simplify the problem by selecting two digits (e.g., "0" and "1")
and train a model to classify images as either one or the other. This task introduces basic
classification concepts and evaluation methods.

3. Multiclass Classification
In multiclass classification, the model is trained to recognize all ten digits (0-9) in the
MNIST dataset. Common algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, and Neural Networks are
applied and compared.

5. Multilabel Classification
In multilabel classification, each input can be assigned multiple labels. For example, we could
label each image based on whether it contains specific patterns (e.g., loops or lines) in
addition to identifying the digit itself. This task explores models capable of handling such outputs.

7. Multioutput Classification
Multioutput classification is a more complex problem where each input may have multiple outputs
that can be either binary or multiclass. For instance, we could predict both the digit and a
corresponding feature (e.g., the stroke width) for each image.

## Performance Measures
1. Measuring Accuracy Using Cross-Validation
Accuracy is one of the most straightforward metrics for evaluating classification models,
representing the proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions. To avoid
overfitting and better assess the model's generalization ability, k-fold cross-validation
is used. This method splits the dataset into k subsets, trains the model on k-1 subsets,
and tests it on the remaining one.
2. Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model.
It gives detailed insight into the types of errors your model is making by comparing actual
vs. predicted labels

3. Precision and Recall
Precision and Recall are crucial performance metrics, especially when dealing with imbalanced
datasets where one class may dominate the others.

4. The ROC Curve
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is another essential evaluation tool, especially
when handling binary classification problems. It plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the
False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold levels. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is used
to summarize the curve into a single number, with 1.0 indicating perfect classification.


## Error Analysis
Error analysis helps identify the areas where our models perform poorly. Misclassifications are
analyzed in detail to uncover common failure modes such as confusing similar digits (e.g., "3" and "8"). 
This analysis provides insights into potential improvements, such as:

Data augmentation: Increase model robustness by simulating different writing styles.
Algorithm tuning: Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
Ensemble models: Combine multiple models to reduce individual weaknesses.
